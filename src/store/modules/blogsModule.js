        coverPhoto: require(`/src/assets/blog/jewelry_designers_of_the_decade/Nikos-Koulis-Earrings - Cover.jpg`),
        intro: `It's been a great decade of jewelry design. Color, form, materials, and even classic diamond designs have been reimagined for modern life. Even serious jewelry has lightened up to become more wearable and personal.
        After JCK published a list of their editor picks for the designers of the decade, it got me thinking about the jewelry I've seen over the past ten years. Which designers have been most influential? What criteria are most important?
        Should I include the perennially influential like JAR, Hemmerle, and Suzanne Belperron? (I didn't but they could always be included!)  When I sat down to make my own list of the most important designers of the decade,
        I concentrated on the ones who have changed the way that we see jewelry today the most. Enjoy more photos of jewelry from these designers on my Jewelry Designers of the Decade Pinterest board: choosing just one photo for each was almost impossible.
        And let me know your picks for designers of the decade in the comments!`,

            content: `Fine jewelry has never been more colorful and that's certainly due in part to the inspiring designs of James de Givenchy for Taffin,
            the company he founded in New York in 1996. A 16-carat antique cut sapphire of exceptional color sits in a frame of robin's egg, mustard and ultramarine ceramic.
             A kite shaped fancy yellow diamond is set off with chili colored ceramic. Fire opal is set in wood and strung on a cord or surrounded by a cloud of moonstones.
             Rings have a private surprise of color inside for the secret pleasure of the wearer. This is haute joallerie transformed by the sensibilities of modern art.`,

            The Electric, Fusion and Stream collections were unlike anything we'd ever seen before with unique cuts, and fluid, sensual shapes.
            But what really launched Jorge into the top ranks of the decade's designers was his 2017 Brilliant Collection, kinetic sculptures in diamonds and gold.
            Delicate and bold, with modern red-carpet ready silhouettes, the Brilliant Collection established Jorge as a serial innovator with an impressive range.`,

             making baguettes the coolest cut and chaos the new black. Fireworks began as explosions of off-kilter diamond baguettes, eventually adding a rainbow of sapphires too.
             But it's the pieces that reimagine the classics of diamond jewelry that are the most compelling. In Fireworks, Kalan created irresistibly cool and modern version of diamond
              stud earrings, band rings, bangles, pendants. Wearable and distinctive at the same time, they are the new diamond essentials of a jewelry wardrobe.`,

            Of course, that feeling didn't last, because almost immediately, this iconic design and its variations were copied in a thousand different diamond fashion collections.
             In fact, these designs actually became an entire new category of diamond fashion jewelry, diamond line rings. Eva Fehren designer Eva Zuckerman herself moved into bridal versions,
             adding hexagonal diamonds and generally showing how cool wedding rings could be. Whether the million women wearing jewelry based on the original X Ring know the Eva Fehren brand,
             she is undoubtedly one of the most important jewelry designers of the decade.`,

        preview includes all the entries, not just the winners.  Although the winners are always good, it's nice to find favorites that might have been overlooked by the judges too.
        And seeing all the entries gives you a much better idea of overall trends in gemstone jewelry designs. This year, bicolor tourmaline was hot. Emerald also featured in many designs
        (thanks no doubt in part to the fact that emerald mining company Muzo Colombian Emeralds is working with designers to promote its gems).

        intro: `Metal & Smith promotes itself as #notatradeshow and it is quite different from the other jewelry trade shows I attend each year. It's in a non-traditional pop-up space near
        Javitz in New York. It's only one day, which really does focus your mind.  Each designer has a single table. It can be a bit overwhelming at first when you walk into a room with every
        surface covered in sparkle.  So. Much. Jewelry. So. Little. Time. Overall, I really do like the speed-date format: you meet a designer, get an overview of her (or his) greatest hits,
        and onto the next. It's definitely challenging not to be able to sit down and go through the entire collection but it makes for a very productive and efficient day. My favorite part
        of Metal & Smith is that I always (well, at each of the two shows I've been to so far) meet someone fabulous and new. I'm sure that I missed something amazing, so apologies to people
        I didn't see this time. And there were some fabulous things that I wasn't able to get a good image of too. (I hope to catch more great designs at the next edition on August 21.)
        These are my favorite ten pieces from the Spring edition of Metal & Smith.`,
