        Bag" to add the Product(s) you wish to purchase to your Shopping Bag.
        Then proceed by clicking "Proceed to Purchase" to log into our secure
        servers to complete your Order.
        <br />
        <br />

        3.3 If this is your first purchase on our Site you will have the option
        to register and create an account with us using your email address and
        you will also be asked to create a password. You must keep this password
        confidential and not disclose it to any third party. You will then be
        asked to input your address. The address that you register with must be
        the address that the card statement is sent to, however you can use a
        different delivery address if you so wish. If you have already
        registered with us you may enter your sign in details to access your
        account.
        <br />
        <br />

        3.4 Once signed in or registered, as the case may be, you must select
        your preferred method of delivery (if any delivery charges are payable
        these will then be added to the amount you will be charged), confirm you

        asked to confirm your delivery address and input your payment details.
        <br />
        <br />

        3.5 Once you have finished compiling your Order, you will be asked to
        confirm that your Order is correct. If it is not correct, you can
        revisit your Order and correct the mistakes before confirming and
        submitting your Order to us. It is your responsibility to ensure that
        your Order is correct before submitting it to us.
        <br />
        <br />

        3.6 We will then send you a confirmation email (including your order
        reference number) to acknowledge that we have received your Order
        ("Confirmation"). This is sent to the email address you register with
        us. After sending you the Confirmation we will process the payment
        details you have given to us to take payment for your Order.
        <br />

        3.7 If and when we are able to do so, we will send you a second email
        confirming dispatch of the Product(s) to the delivery address you have
        requested and giving you estimated timescales for delivery.

        second email to you confirming your Order and dispatch of the Product(s)
        and after payment is taken from your credit or debit card. Our
        acceptance of your Order will be considered for all purposes to have
        been effectively communicated to you at the time SHOPPE sends an order
        despatched email and it is at this point that a legally binding contract
        is formed between you and SHOPPE for the purchase of Products
        ("Contract").
        <br />
        <br />

        3.9 If we are unable to fulfil your Order, you will receive an email

        4.2 Unfortunately, if we have already sent you the second email referred
        to in cl 3.8 we are unable to change your Order, although you will still

      <p class="content-conditions body-small">
        5.1 We are unable to process any engraving request or gift card messages
        containing profanities or inappropriate language. Where possible, we
        will contact you to seek an alternative engraving or gift message and we
        will do this before we send you the second confirmatory email in respect
        of your Order.
        <br />
        <br />

        5.2 As outlined at 11.3 below, you do not have any right to (a) cancel

        and/or (c) exchange any Product/s that have been engraved or otherwise
        made to your bespoke specifications (unless such Product/s were damaged,
        defective or faulty when delivered to you or have been incorrectly
        delivered).
      </p>

      <span class="subtitle">6 Price</span>
      <p class="content-conditions body-small">
        6.1 When you submit your Order, you are offering to buy the Product(s)
        at the price set out in the Order.
        <br />
        <br />

        6.2 Where you are ordering for delivery to the UK, all prices are
        inclusive of VAT in the UK. Delivery charges (where applicable) for
        delivery to the UK will be shown when you view the Product(s) in your
        Shopping Bag.
        <br />
        <br />

        6.3 Where you are ordering for delivery to the European Union, you act
        as the importer of the Product(s) into the European Union (commonly
        known as the “Importer of Record”). The price we display includes import
        duty and taxes which we shall pay to the relevant authorities on your
        behalf. You hereby authorise us to make such payments on your behalf.
        The import duty, import taxes and delivery charges (where applicable)
        for delivery to the E.U. are included in the total amount due when you
        view the Product(s) in your Shopping Bag.
        <br />
        <br />

        6.4 Where you are ordering for delivery to the United States, we will
        add any applicable state taxes and any delivery charges and display
        these in the total amount due on the checkout page.
        <br />
        <br />

        6.5 Where you are ordering for delivery to anywhere other than the U.K.,
        the European Union or the United States, all prices are inclusive of any
        applicable import duties or taxes. Delivery charges (where applicable)
        will be shown when you view the Product(s) in your Shopping Bag.
        <br />

        6.6 The total amount payable by you will be displayed before you confirm
        your Order and will be set out in the confirmatory email you receive
        from us.
        <br />
        <br />

        6.7 Our prices may change at any time. If we discover that the price for
        a Product has changed or that there has been a pricing error when we
        receive your Order we will contact you and ask if you wish to proceed at
        the correct price. If you confirm that you do wish to proceed, please
        remember that we will not be under an obligation to supply the
        Product(s) until we have sent you the second email confirming your
        Order.
        <br />
        <br />

        6.8 It is always possible that, despite our best efforts, some of the
        Product(s) we sell may be incorrectly priced. We will normally check
        prices before accepting your order so that, where the Product(s) correct
        price at your order date is less than our stated price at your order
        date, we will charge the lower amount. If the Product(s) correct price
        at your order date is higher than the price stated to you, we will
        contact you for your instructions before we accept your order. If we
        accept and process your order where a pricing error is obvious and
        unmistakeable and could reasonably have been recognised by you as a
        mispricing, we may end the contract, refund you any sums you have paid
        and require the return of any goods provided to you.

        any deterioration, up to the price of the Product(s), from the refund to
        which you are otherwise entitled.

        Product(s) back or, if earlier, the day on which we receive evidence
        that you have returned the Product(s) to our returns address. We will
        refund the price of the Product(s) in full (except for any deduction we
        are entitled to make due to your use of, or damage to, the Product(s),
        or any unnecessary handling by you), including the cost of standard
        delivery. If you have selected a delivery method which is more expensive
        than the standard delivery method (the cheapest option), we will only

        original value of the Product(s), you will be required to pay the
        difference. Should the value of the new Product(s) be lower than the
        original value, the difference will be credited to the credit or debit
        card originally used for the Order.

        contract or our failing to use reasonable care and skill, but we are not
        responsible for any loss or damage that is not foreseeable. Loss or
        damage is foreseeable if either it is obvious that it will happen or if,
